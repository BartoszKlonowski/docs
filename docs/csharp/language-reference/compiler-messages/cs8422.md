# Compiler Error CS8422

A static local function cannot contain a reference to 'this' or 'base'.

As of C# 8.0 [`static`](../keywords/static.md) keyword is allowed to be used with local functions to prevent from accidentially shadowing or anyhow modifying the state of parent methods or instances fields.
<br/>This error is to indicate about such scenario, of mixing contexts, taking place.

## Example

The following sample generates CS8422:

```csharp
public class C
{
    private int counter = 1;
    public void IncreaseCounter()
    {
        static void localFunc(int addition)
        {
            this.counter += addition;   // CS8422 due to reference to 'this'
            base.ToString();            // CS8422 due to reference to 'base'

            // Also for implicit 'this' or 'base' references:
            counter += addition;   // CS8422 due to implicit reference to 'this'
            ToString();            // CS8422 due to implicit reference to 'base'
        }
        localFunc(10);
        Console.WriteLine(this.counter);
    }
}
```

## To correct this error

If there is an intention of local function to capture and modify the state of a parent then it shouldn't be declared static:

```csharp
public class C
{
    private int counter = 1;
    public void IncreaseCounter()
    {
        void localFunc(int addition)
        {
            counter += addition;
            ToString();
        }
        localFunc(10);
        Console.WriteLine(this.counter);
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public void Main()
    {
        C c = new();
        c.IncreaseCounter();
    }
}

// Output:
// 11
```
